# Overview
A sample [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Run
Install dependencies:
```
npm i
```

Replace the following values into the [Canvas.jsx](./src/Canvas.jsx):
- `PUBLIC_TOKEN` by the "Public Token" obtained from the [3dverse console in the "API Access" section](https://3dverse.com/docs/getting-started/setup-your-first-app/#d2f2797242f04420ab89476ea26ca944).
- `SCENE_UUID` by the "ASSET ID" of your public scene obtained from the [3dverse console in the "Asset browser" section](https://3dverse.com/docs/getting-started/setup-your-first-app/#d2f2797242f04420ab89476ea26ca944).

Run the web dev server:
```
npm run dev
```

# Getting Started with Next.js app

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
